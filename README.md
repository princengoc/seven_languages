# Seven Languages in Miniprojects

This repo hosts weekend projects spawned from my reading of [Seven languages in seven weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/).

Here's what I have implemented so far: 

* An infinite ``pacman`` treasure hunt game in ``Clojure``
* A two-player typing game in ``Erlang``
* A zebra puzzle solver in ``Prolog``

I try to keep around both the "final" implementation and earlier attempts. 

Commentaries can be found at [my blog](https://princengoc.github.io/tags/seven%20languages.html).
