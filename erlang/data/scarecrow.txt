I could while away the hours
Conferring with the flowers
Consulting with the rain
And my head, I'd be scratching
While my thoughts were busy hatching
If I only had a brain
I'd unravel every riddle for any individ'le,
In trouble or in pain.
With the thoughts you'll be thinkin', you could be another Lincoln.
If you only had a brain.
Oh I could tell you why the ocean's near the shore.
I could think of things I never thunk before.
And then I'd sit, and think some more.
I would not be just a nothin' my head all full of stuffin
My heart all full of pain.
I would dance and be merry, life would be a ding-a-derry,
If I only had a brain.
